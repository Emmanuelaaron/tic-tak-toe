# Tic-Tac-Toe Project
## Game Instructions!
We built a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.
It was made as a collaborative project in Ruby using OOP concepts.

# What It Does
The game collects input from the users and replaces the board positions based on the user inputs with their individual characters.
To win the game, a player has to have 3 of their characters in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally).

- Player1's character is "X" and Player2's character is "O"
- Players take turns putting their characters on the board with numbers from 1 - 9.
- The first player to get 3 of their characters in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are filled up, the game is over. If no player has 3 characters in a row, the game ends in a tie.
